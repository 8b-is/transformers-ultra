### 📖 The Origin Story: Why `transformers-ultra` Exists

```text
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
And you are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.
                                        — Pink Floyd, Time
```

This fork was born from a moment of pure bureaucratic absurdity:

Peter Lodri ([`@peterlodri-sec`](https://github.com/peterlodri-sec)) opened three PRs against the original upstream repository to fix critical, recurring bugs in 1-bit / 1.58-bit ternary models, BitNet quantization, and Apple Silicon MPS memory leaks. Instead of reviewing the math or benchmarking the speedup, an upstream gatekeeper remarked:

> *"lol this idiot is spamming MY repo"*

...and banned Peter from contributing.

What a weird world. But open source belongs to no single gatekeeper. We didn't complain, we didn't wait for permission—we took the starting gun, fixed every hot path, integrated native Apple Silicon Metal & BitNet kernels, ported MEM8 wave-interference associative memory, eliminated Python reflection overhead from token generation loops, and released **`transformers-ultra`**.

---

### 🛡️ Sovereign Hard Fork & Downstream Upgrades

`8b-is/transformers` operates as a **100% sovereign, independent downstream distribution**. We maintain our own hardened mainline—incorporating critical community bugfixes, security patches, and Apple Silicon / low-bit acceleration without upstream gatekeeping delays.

Transformers acts as the model-definition framework for state-of-the-art machine learning with text, computer
vision, audio, video, and multimodal models, for both inference and training.

It centralizes the model definition so that this definition is agreed upon across the ecosystem. `transformers` is the
pivot across frameworks: if a model definition is supported, it will be compatible with the majority of training
frameworks (Axolotl, Unsloth, DeepSpeed, FSDP, PyTorch-Lightning, ...), inference engines (vLLM, SGLang, TGI, ...),
and adjacent modeling libraries (llama.cpp, mlx, ...) which leverage the model definition from `transformers`.

We pledge to help support new state-of-the-art models and democratize their usage by having their model definition be
simple, customizable, and efficient.

There are over 1M+ Transformers [model checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers&sort=trending) on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) you can use.

Explore the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/) today to find a model and use Transformers to help you get started right away.

## Installation

Transformers works with Python 3.10+, and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) 2.5+.

Create and activate a virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a fast Rust-based Python package and project manager.

```py
# venv
python -m venv .my-env
source .my-env/bin/activate
# uv
uv venv .my-env
source .my-env/bin/activate
```

Install Transformers in your virtual environment.

```py
# pip
pip install "transformers[torch]"

# uv
uv pip install "transformers[torch]"
```

Install Transformers from source if you want the latest changes in the library or are interested in contributing. However, the *latest* version may not be stable. Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues) if you encounter an error.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
cd transformers

# pip
pip install '.[torch]'

# uv
uv pip install '.[torch]'
```

## Quickstart

Get started with Transformers right away with the [Pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pipeline_tutorial) API. The `Pipeline` is a high-level inference class that supports text, audio, vision, and multimodal tasks. It handles preprocessing the input and returns the appropriate output.

Instantiate a pipeline and specify model to use for text generation. The model is downloaded and cached so you can easily reuse it again. Finally, pass some text to prompt the model.

```py
from transformers import pipeline

pipeline = pipeline(task="text-generation", model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B")
pipeline("the secret to baking a really good cake is ")
[{'generated_text': 'the secret to baking a really good cake is 1) to use the right ingredients and 2) to follow the recipe exactly. the recipe for the cake is as follows: 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of butter, 1 cup of eggs, 1 cup of chocolate chips. if you want to make 2 cakes, how much sugar do you need? To make 2 cakes, you will need 2 cups of sugar.'}]
```

To chat with a model, the usage pattern is the same. The only difference is you need to construct a chat history (the input to `Pipeline`) between you and the system.

> [!TIP]
> You can also chat with a model directly from the command line, as long as [`transformers serve` is running](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/serving).
> ```shell
> transformers chat Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
> ```

```py
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

chat = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a sassy, wise-cracking robot as imagined by Hollywood circa 1986."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hey, can you tell me any fun things to do in New York?"}
]

pipeline = pipeline(task="text-generation", model="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")
response = pipeline(chat, max_new_tokens=512)
print(response[0]["generated_text"][-1]["content"])
```

## Why should I use Transformers?

1. Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models:
    - High performance on natural language understanding & generation, computer vision, audio, video, and multimodal tasks.
    - Low barrier to entry for researchers, engineers, and developers.
    - Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn.
    - A unified API for using all our pretrained models.

1. Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:
    - Share trained models instead of training from scratch.
    - Reduce compute time and production costs.
    - Hundreds of model architectures with 1M+ pretrained checkpoints across all modalities.

1. Choose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime:
    - Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code.
    - Move a single model between PyTorch/JAX/TF2.0 frameworks at will.
    - Pick the right framework for training, evaluation, and production.

1. Easily customize a model or an example to your needs:
    - We provide examples for each architecture to reproduce the results published by its original authors.
    - Model internals are exposed as consistently as possible.
    - Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments.

</a><br>

## When shouldn't I use Transformers?

- This library is not a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. The code in the model files is not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose, so that researchers can quickly iterate on each of the models without diving into additional abstractions/files.
- The training API is optimized to work with PyTorch models provided by Transformers. For generic machine learning loops, you should use another library like [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate).
- The [example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples) are only *examples*. They may not necessarily work out-of-the-box on your specific use case and you'll need to adapt the code for it to work.

## 100 projects using Transformers

Transformers is more than a toolkit to use pretrained models, it's a community of projects built around it and the
Hugging Face Hub. We want Transformers to enable developers, researchers, students, professors, engineers, and anyone
else to build their dream projects.

In order to celebrate Transformers 100,000 stars, we wanted to put the spotlight on the
community with the [awesome-transformers](./awesome-transformers.md) page which lists 100
incredible projects built with Transformers.

If you own or use a project that you believe should be part of the list, please open a PR to add it!

### 16. 📐 High-Performance Sparse Linear Algebra Engine (`sparsemat/sprs`)

[`sparsemat/sprs`](https://github.com/sparsemat/sprs) is the official sparse linear algebra foundation for `transformers-ultra` and the sovereign constellation:

* **Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) & Column (CSC) Structures**:
  Enables zero-allocation Sparse Matrix Multiplication ($\text{SpMM}$) and Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication ($\text{SpMV}$) for token positions pruned by the **DYAD Asymmetric Loss Modulation Engine**.
* **$O(\text{nnz})$ Linear Scalability**:
  When context masks are pruned to 10%–30% density, `sprs` representation cuts attention FLOPs from $O(N^2)$ to $O(\text{nnz})$, eliminating memory bandwidth bottlenecks.
* **Ternary BitNet 1.58b Structural Sparsity**:
  Leverages zero-weight sparsity in ternary networks ($\{-1, 0, +1\}$) to skip arithmetic operations entirely, using `sprs` compressed index traversal.

```rust
use sprs::{CsMatI, TriMatI};

// Constructing a DYAD sparse attention mask kernel (O(nnz) compute)
let mut tri = TriMatI::<f32, u32>::new((seq_len, seq_len));
for (row, col, weight) in dyad_sparse_entries {
    tri.add_triplet(row, col, weight);
}
let csr_attention_mask: CsMatI<f32, u32> = tri.to_csr();
```
